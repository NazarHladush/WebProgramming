                <p>Austin Richard Post (born July 4, 1995), known professionally as Post Malone, is an American rapper,
                    singer, songwriter and record producer. He has gained acclaim for blending musical genres including
                    pop, trap and rock, his introspective songwriting, and his laconic vocal style. Born in Syracuse,
                    New York and raised in Grapevine, Texas, Post first attained recognition in 2015 following the
                    release of his debut single "White Iverson" which peaked in the top 20 on the US Billboard Hot 100.
                    He subsequently earned a recording contract with Republic Records.

                    Post's debut studio album Stoney (2016) peaked at number four on the US Billboard 200, and was
                    eventually certified triple platinum, and featured the hit "Congratulations". Post's second album
                    Beerbongs & Bentleys (2018) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and broke several streaming
                    records upon release. The album opened to mixed critical reception and contained the US
                    chart-topping songs "Rockstar", "Psycho" and "Better Now". It was nominated for Album of the Year at
                    the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. In 2018, he collaborated with Swae Lee on the song "Sunflower" for
                    the soundtrack to the film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which also reached atop the Hot 100.
                    He then released the song "Wow", which was the first single from his third studio album, Hollywood's
                    Bleeding. It peaked at number two on the Hot 100. He returned in July 2019, releasing the single
                    "Goodbyes", which features Young Thug and debuted at number three on the Hot 100. Post Malone
                    released his third album, Hollywood's Bleeding, on September 6, 2019; it features "Wow", "Goodbyes",
                    "Sunflower", and "Circles", with the latter serving as its third single in August 2019.
